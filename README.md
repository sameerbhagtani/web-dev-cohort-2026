# ☕ ChaiCode Web Development Cohort (2026)

## 📂 How this Archive is Structured

This repository acts as a central index for my work. To keep things modular and deployment-ready:

- **Separate Repositories:** Every project and assignment lives in its own dedicated repository.
- **Internal Navigation:** The Markdown files in this repo serve as quick-access directories. They contain direct links to the source code, live demos, and a visual preview (screenshot) of the work.
- **Blog Archive:** The blog Markdown files provide a quick summary/cover image and a direct link to the full article on **Hashnode**.
